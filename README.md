Hello everybody.
What does a data-driven woman do when she wants to formally work with data? That's right she uses...data!! :D 

This is my first project using the python language to parse some data from a tabular dataset and for that, I wanted to explore
some analytics tools and answer some questions of my interest about Sectors that hire data analysts, 
the size of companies, relationships between variables and what the job description says about topics I would like to know as a beginner. 
The database has been pulled from the kaggle website(kaggle.com) and the project was developed using jupyter notebook.

Among the many different challenges I had in the construction of this project, the most challenging was, without any doubt, having to deal with so much data containing characters and how to manipulate them in the best possible way.

What I learned during this project:

-compare the libraries for data visualization and use the one that represents my data more clearly
-how to manipulate data in the best way for your purpose. There is no rule and much less a magic formula
-How to use regular expressions and lambda function in python
-how to write straight and lean codes


Please feel free to contact me with suggestions, I am always oppened for it!
