Hello everybody.
What does a data-driven person do when they want to formally work with data? That's right she uses...data!! :D 

This is my first project using the python language to parse some data from tabular data and for that, I wanted to explore
some analytics tools and answer some questions of my interest about Sectors that hire data analysts, 
the size of companies, relationships between variables and what the job description says about topics I would like to know as a beginner. 
The database has been pulled from the kaggle website(kaggle.com) and the project was developed using jupyter notebook.

Please feel free to contact me with suggestions, I am always oppened for it! 
Marina.
